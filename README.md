# Simulation the Spread of COVID-19 Using the Monte Carlo Method
This program was created as part of an assessment task for the MMC (Metoda Monte Carlo) course at FNSPE CTU. Its aim is to provide a means to simulate the spread of COVID-19 in an isolated population of humans.

The main driving file is `covid_19_simulation.m` which contains the input configuration.
